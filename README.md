Exploration of titanic survival dataset 

This is a Udacity - Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegree - optional project

Dataset and copyright are from Udacity.

PURPOSE: Apply the principle of decision tree algorithm.

Through this project, we attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age.
We start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.
